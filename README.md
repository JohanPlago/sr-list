SR List
===

A Symfony3 application that searches Sveriges Radio's episodes, fetches the songs played during that
episode and links the results to Spotify tracks.

** So far this project is just started. And I styling is yet to make :) ***

##Wish/to do list:
 - Caching!
 - Real styling
 - Log in with Spotify and create playlists from the episode's track
 - Show "currently playing" tracks
